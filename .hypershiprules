# Project Context for Hypership Template

## Framework

- Next.js with App Router

## Important Notes

- Providers.tsx is a protected file that must remain unchanged
- Providers.tsx is used by Hypership to provide auth, analytics, and events to the app
- Create modular React components instead of monolithic page files
- Break down complex UI into reusable components
- Place components in appropriate directories based on their scope and usage
- If you use external images, make sure you add the top level domain of that image to next.config.ts in the domains array.
